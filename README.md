# password-generator
Added JOptionPane to create a more beautiful interaction with the user but still has some **limitations:**
 - No way to write a password longer than 80 characters, but since this is not the point of the generator. I don't see as a problem, but the longer the password the weirdest it gets. if you type 79 characters for your password the answer should **always** be 79 ")" (not even kidding).
 - There is not a way to copy the password directly from the message pane, which is annoying. (just a demo project anyway). But I made it showing up on the console as well, so It is indeed copiable.
 - Don't forget to have updated JDK or JRE on your device so you have no problems.
