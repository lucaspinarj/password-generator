# password-generator
Added JOptionPane to create a more beautiful interaction with the user but still has some little **limitations:**
 - Since this is an OTP password generator, you can't create longer than 25 characters passwords
 - You can't reuse the app multiple times after you've generated your password, if you want another one, you'll need to open it again in order to have it.
 - There are some other password 
 - Don't forget to have updated JDK or JRE on your device so you have no problems.
